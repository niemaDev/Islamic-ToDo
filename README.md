# Islamic To-Do App

This is my very first React project!  
I’m building it step by step as part of the **NSDA React Beginners Track**.  
Each week I add new features, fix mistakes, and learn something new about React.

# My Weekly Progress

# Week 1

I started simple: made a homepage that says  
**“Welcome to My Islamic To-Do App”** and added a header with navigation links.

# Week 2

I created a `TaskCard` component that can show a task’s title and due date.  
Then I reused it to display a list of tasks.

# Week 3

I added a button to add new tasks using `useState`.  
I also made a “Complete” button so I can check off finished tasks .

# Week 4

I made it so all tasks show in a list.  
When everything is done, the app shows a motivational message like:  
**“Keep up the good work!”**

# Week 5

This week was all about `useEffect`.  
I used it to fetch a daily Islamic quote from an API.  
If it’s loading, the app shows a spinner until the quote appears.

# Week 6

I learned how to save data in **localStorage**.  
Now, even if I refresh the page, my tasks don’t disappear.

# Week 7

I built a form to add new tasks with a title and a due date.  
I also added validation so I can’t add empty tasks (no cheating ).

# Week 8

Time to make it pretty!  
I styled the task cards and buttons, and added a light/dark mode toggle .

# Week 9

I started organizing my code better.  
I created reusable components like `TaskList`, `QuoteSection`, and `Loading`.

# Week 10

Navigation time
I added **React Router** to move between pages, and the current page link now highlights in the navbar.

# Week 11

This week was about making the app more user-friendly:

- Added error messages and fallbacks (no more crashes ).
- Made the layout mobile-friendly so it looks good on small screens.
- Improved accessibility (better colors, aria-labels, keyboard-friendly).
- Fixed the task form sizing so inputs and buttons look balanced.

# What I Used

- **React + Vite**
- **React Router**
- **LocalStorage**
- **Plain CSS** (with dark mode + responsive design)

# Why I’m Doing This

I’m following the NSDA React beginners track to practice React.  
This is my first React app, and I’m learning something new every single week.

# What’s Next

- Adding even more features (maybe a backend 👀).
- Making the app feel more professional.
- Keep practicing React until it becomes second nature.
